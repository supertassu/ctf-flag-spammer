# ctf-flag-spammer
ctf-flag-spammer is a small Python program that submits predefined flags
to a [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) game as soon as the challenges become
available (and when the script has been run after that).

## but why?
This is in the series of "weirdly specific software that probably isn't
generally useful", but I decided to publish it anyways. It still has a
working example of using the CTFd API with Python and since the reason
why I needed this isn't relevant anymore I have no reason to keep this
private. If you manage to find a use case, please
[tell me about it](https://taavi.wtf/#contact).
